# Point-defect-analysis-GUI
This is a program that finds MoTe2 point vacancy defects using pytorch-based deep learning. 
Also, it can be used without a separate GPU power. (If you have enough CPU power)


## Getting started
This program was tested for stability in Python 3.9.0 version. Therefore, we recommend using version 3.9.0.

1. Git clone or download this repository.

2. utilize requirements.txt to install the required libraries.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Unzip CNN-1 and CNN-2 and place the same files in the same(default) directory.

4. Go to the current directory in the anaconda prompt window and enter the code below:

```
python dist/GUI_CPU.py
```

## How to use the program

1. Click “Load image” to load the STEM image you want to analyze.
